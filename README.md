GoogleBooksDownloadwrapper
==========================

A ruby wrapper to use with GoogleBooksDownloader.jar. It downloads the pages of a book I choose from Google Books as .jpg 
and creates a .zip file with the pages.
You just need to specify the link of the book you want to download and the name you want to give to the .zip file. 
You will also need the GoogleBooksDownloader.jar, available at: https://github.com/bhattumang7/Google-Books-Downloader
